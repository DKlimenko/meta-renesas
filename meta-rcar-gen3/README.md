This layer provides that evaluation board is mounted ARM SoCs of Renesas
Electronics, called the R-Car Generation 3. Currently, this supports
board and the SoCs of the following:
- Board: Salvator-X / SoC: R8A7795 (R-Car H3), R8A7796 (R-Car M3), R8A77965 (R-Car M3N)
- Board: R-Car Starter Kit premier(H3ULCB) / SoC: R8A7795 (R-Car H3)
- Board: R-Car Starter Kit pro(M3ULCB) / SoC: R8A7796 (R-Car M3)
- Board: R-Car Starter Kit pro(M3NULCB) / SoC: R8A77965 (R-Car M3N)
- Board: Ebisu / SoC: R8A77990 (R-Car E3)

## Patches

Please submit any patches for this layer to: takamitsu.honda.pv@renesas.com
Please see the MAINTAINERS file for more details.

## Dependencies

This layer depends on:

    URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
    layers: meta, meta-poky, meta-yocto-bsp
    branch: rocko

    URI: git://git.linaro.org/openembedded/meta-linaro.git
    layers: meta-optee
    branch: rocko

    URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
    layers: meta-oe
    branch: rocko

## Build Instructions

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

This also needs git user name and email defined:
```bash
   $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. e.g.:
```bash
    $ source poky/oe-init-build-env
```

After that, initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding meta-rcar-gen3 layer. e.g.:
```bash
    BBLAYERS ?= " \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-poky \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
        <path to layer>/meta-renesas/meta-rcar-gen3 \
        <path to layer>/meta-linaro/meta-optee \
        <path to layer>/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    "
```
To build a specific target BSP, configure the associated machine in local.conf:
```bash
    MACHINE ??= "<supported board name>"
```

Board|MACHINE
-----|-------
Salvator-X/XS|MACHINE="salvator-x"
Ebisu|MACHINE="ebisu"
Starter Kit Pro (M3ULCB)|MACHINE="m3ulcb"
Starter Kit Pro (M3NULCB)|MACHINE="m3nulcb"
Starter Kit Premier (H3ULCB)|MACHINE="h3ulcb"

Select the SOC:
```bash
    For H3: r8a7795
    SOC_FAMILY = "r8a7795"

    For M3: r8a7796
    SOC_FAMILY = "r8a7796"

    For M3N: r8a77965
    SOC_FAMILY = "r8a77965"

    For E3: r8a77990
    SOC_FAMILY = "r8a77990"
    Already added in machine config: ebisu.conf
```
Configure for systemd init in local.conf:
```bash
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
    VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
```
Configure for ivi-shell and ivi-extension
```bash
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " ivi-shell"
```
Configure for USB 3.0
```bash
    MACHINE_FEATURES_append = " usb3"
```
Enable tuning support for Capacity Aware migration Strategy (CAS)
```bash
    MACHINE_FEATURES_append = " cas"
```

For a list of sample local.conf file, please refer to: [docs/sample/conf/](docs/sample/conf/)

Build the target file system image using bitbake:
```bash
    $ bitbake core-image-minimal
```
After completing the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory _'tmp/deploy/images/<supported board name>'_.

Images generated:
* Image (generic Linux Kernel binary image file)
* Image-<machine name>.dtb (DTB for target machine)
* core-image-minimal-<machine name>.tar.bz2 (rootfs tar+bzip2)
* core-image-minimal-<machine name>.ext4  (rootfs ext4 format)

## Build Instructions for SDK

This may be changed in the near feature. These instructions are tentative.

Should define the staticdev in SDK image feature for installing the static libs
to SDK in local.conf.
```bash
    SDKIMAGE_FEATURES_append = " staticdev-pkgs"
```
Use bitbake -c populate_sdk for generating the toolchain SDK:
For 64-bit target SDK (aarch64):
```bash
    $ bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk
```
The SDK can be found in the output directory _'tmp/deploy/sdk'_

    poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-x.x.sh

Usage of toolchain SDK: Install the SDK to the default: _/opt/poky/x.x_
For 64-bit target SDK:
```bash
    $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-x.x.sh
```
For 64-bit application use environment script in _/opt/poky/x.x_
```bash
    $ source /opt/poky/x.x/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```
